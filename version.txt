Sample file that acts as the only source of version in the repository

version: 2304.06.01+23040601

The above versioning format of `${version_name}+${build_number}` is used by flutter in pubspec.yaml
For native apps, the file and the format will be different, and `version.rb` script has to be modified
for the automated workflows to continue working like they are with the above format
